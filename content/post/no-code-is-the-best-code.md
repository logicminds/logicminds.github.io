I heard this quote a while back and I keep repeating for all to hear. 

The theory is quite simple:

  * Less is more
  * Reduces complexity
  * Improves performance
  * Reduces loading times
  * No tests needed for the deleted code
  * No documentation needed for the deleted code
  * Readability is enhanced

Reduce.  Resuse.  Delete.
