"No code, is the best code."

I heard this quote a while back and I keep repeating for all the hear. 

The theory is quite simple.  Less is more.  Remove dead code.  Delete old code.  Reduce complexity.

If there is no code, there are not tests, no bugs, no documentation and easier peer reviews.  The compiler needs less time, the cpu uses less cycles and code readablity is enhanced.

Reduce.  Resuse.  Delete.
