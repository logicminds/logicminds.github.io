I heard from an old grey beard a while ago that back in the day they used to write code on a remote computer using telnet.  Petrsonal computers at that time just weren't powerful enough to compile code, so developers relied on centralized system to crunch the code.   Now, fast forward 40+ years and not only is it possible to use personal computers to crunch code but we can do so at great speed.  In the last 10-20 years we have shifted our focus to development environment and workflow efficiency instead. 

But now we are presented with a different problem with a similar solution.  The problem being is that development environments take a while to setup properely.  Some of us are polyglots and require different tooling for
