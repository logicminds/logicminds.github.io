Let's face it. DevOps has peaked and is now dying a slow death from obfuscation. How do I know? Recruiters can never source good DevOps talent, yet every company is doing "DevOps" without the good talent. How can these mutually exclusive things exist?

Many Organizations still struggle with operations and development, let alone a practice that combines the two. DevOps was supposed to be a way out of a self induced coma. But somewhere along the line companies forgot about their most valuable asset and thus continue to struggle despite having DevOps. The promise of automation almost a decade ago hasn't come true for most organizations.

### Why?

- Was it the executive who demanded DevOps and hired cheap offshore help?
- Was it the manager who rebadged a pure operations team overnight into lean, agile DevOps knights?
  `With this bash script I knight thee, welcome to DevOps hood, now go move that server to the other datacenter`
- Was it the manager who feared training their staff was too costly?
  `If you think an expert is expensive, wait till you hire a beginner`
- The good employees left after they were educated?

Let's take a knee for a second, because the issue of education plays a huge factor in the death of DevOps. You don't know what you don't know. When a human learns they are less likely to make the same mistake. So why would a company not want to prevent mistakes? This is the reason why the military constantly trains and runs exercises. They are merely just unit testing their Ops department. Training should be the number one job at any company just like the military. Why are we judged purely on what we know? We should be judged based on how we learn and reach for additional enlightenment. If a company is afraid of losing an employee due to training, news flash that employee was going to leave anyway.

Furthermore, training should be seen as a global improvement program where the entire technical pool gets stronger everywhere and everyone wins. Imagine if college was free. The bar would be raised and concerns would be different.

I have seem companies train throughly on security best practices but come up short when it comes to providing actual job training. These are mandated HR and security trainings by the way. Why don't we have mandated trainings on our actual job duties? Could you imagine a workplace where you were rewarded if you spent 5 days a month learning about Docker, Kubernetes, Go, CI/CD, Prometheus? OMG! Sign me up! Seriously, where can I find this company?

If a company actually had this policy recruiters would not be needed because people would flock to them. They would need a good hiring filter process though.

They say education has the biggest payoff. Why? Because it is fucking true. When have you ever succeeded in work/life by ignoring the changes around you?

How many of you have had a manager ask which software you want (not need) in order to fullfill a yearly budget? What about education?

DevOps is dead because companies do not value education the same way they value features and the efficient promise of software. How many of us will suffer education budget cuts after a bad quarter or executive pay increase?

How many of us can work 1.5X more efficiently after learning about ZSH, Vim, VS Code, Ruby, Fish or even some unknown git commands?

Why I value education more than anything?

- An untrained professional can code bugs way faster than a trained professional.
- An untrained professional is not constantly learning and improving themselves.
- An untrained professional is fighting fires constantly. Never has time and is burnt out (no pun intended).
- An untrained professional cannot see the bigger picture and often spends time in the weeds for nothing.

I am not here to lay blame on any individual. It is not the individual's fault they don't know how to scale a web service, that is the company's fault. An individual at the end of the day is raising kids, preparing meals, meditating, playing cards against humanity, drinking beer, scaling mountains, floating rivers, and binge watching NetFlix shows.

However, some organizations and people took DevOps seriously and ate their competition for breakfast. Anybody remember Blockbuster?

While this article is purely my opionion filled with experience and observations, some of you devops purests might aggree with me. So who killed DevOps?

Since most companies care little about their employess let's just say the bottom line is at stake.

Personally, DevOps was about taking the time to understand an issue at the core and solving that issue.

So for 2019. Let us forget about DevOps. Instead let us birth the term KnowOps and educate, share knowledge and value learning and education higher than any other buzzword.

Lets demand those executives to fund KnowOps instead of DevOps. We don't know what we don't know. But it is our job to find out. Your job may not change, but your ability to automate with a plethorea of new knowledge will catipult the company into the future for sure. Let us value human intelligence over expensive artifical intelligence.

- KnowOps for 2019
