This concoction has allowed us to create one-off ephemeral test environments that we all love simply by creating a new git branch.
Since R10k was first introduced we have always used the promotion workflow to usher features into environments. While this workflow served us well there is a different kind of code setup that is now possible with R10k that improves upon what we already know.</description></item></channel></rss>
